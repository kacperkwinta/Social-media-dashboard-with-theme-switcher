# Frontend Mentor - Social media dashboard iwth theme switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard iwth theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

**It was a little bit challenging project because of the theme switcher. It's my first project with that functionality. Code may be a little bit unstructured, sorry for this 😅 also sometimes I have some problems with proper class names... 💢 I should make friends with BEM**
